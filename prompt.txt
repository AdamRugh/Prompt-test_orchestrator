Prompt: 
"Copilot, remind me of the plan we made for building a prompt-driven test automation platform. 
It should include: 
- Copilot as the AI agent to turn natural language into structured test steps
- Node.js orchestrator service as the traffic controller
- Selenium MCP for browser/UI testing
- Node.js for API testing
- Python for DB testing
- A persistence layer to save prompts and results for regression
- A regression runner to replay saved prompts
- CI/CD integration for nightly or deployment runs

Please restate the step-by-step architecture, the recommended first sprint, and why this approach is efficient and agile."
