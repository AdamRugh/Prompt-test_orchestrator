Prompt: 
"Copilot, remind me of the plan we made for building a prompt-driven test automation platform. 
It should include: 
- Copilot as the AI agent to turn natural language into structured test steps
- Node.js orchestrator service as the traffic controller
- Selenium MCP for browser/UI testing
- Node.js for API testing
- Python for DB testing
- A persistence layer to save prompts and results for regression
- A regression runner to replay saved prompts
- CI/CD integration for nightly or deployment runs

Please restate the step-by-step architecture, the recommended first sprint, and why this approach is efficient and agile."


Remind me how we set up the demo where a user sends a prompt like "Run UI login test" and the dispatcher routes it to the UI engine, which uses Selenium MCP to launch a browser, run a test, and return results — all integrated with persistence

Let's continue building the hybrid demo where I show a simple UI, talk to the Copilot agent, and run a Selenium MCP test against https://demoqa.com/text-box. I want the demo to highlight both auto-fill with generated data and manual entry mode, with slow steps so it's easy to watch.
